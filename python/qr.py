def classical_gram_schmidt():
    """
    The classic Gram-Schmidt algorithm is the first thing you might think of for producing an orthogonal set of vectors. For each vector in your data set, remove its projection onto the data set, normalize what is left, and include it in the orthogonal set. Here is the code. X is the original set of vectors, Q is the resulting set of orthogonal vectors, and R is the set of coefficients, organized into an upper triangular matrix.
