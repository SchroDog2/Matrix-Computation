# Comparison of QR Factorization Algorithms for Matrix Decomposition


## Goal
The aim of this project is to compare the performance of different QR factorization algorithms for matrix decomposition, including 
- classical Gram-Schmidt 
- modified Gram-Schmidt
- Householder reflection
- Givens rotation methods


## Methodology

1. Review the theory and properties of QR factorization and its applications in linear algebra, statistics, optimization, and signal processing.

2. Implement the four QR factorization algorithms in a programming language 

3. Generate a set of random matrices with varying sizes and ranks (e.g., 10x10, 100x100, 1000x1000) and conditions (e.g., well-conditioned, ill-conditioned, sparse, dense).

4. Apply each QR factorization algorithm to the matrices and measure their computation time, accuracy, and stability.
Compare the results in terms of efficiency, robustness, numerical stability, and accuracy, using appropriate metrics and visualization tools.

5. Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm and draw conclusions on their relative performance for different types of matrices and applications.
